# Understanding JavaScript's Event Loop

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how asynchronous operations work in JavaScript through Node.js's event loop. The event loop is a fundamental concept that enables JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded.

## Basic Concept

JavaScript executes code in a single thread, which means it can only do one thing at a time. However, operations like reading files or making network requests can take a long time to complete. Instead of blocking the entire program while waiting, JavaScript uses an asynchronous approach.

## Example Code

Here's a simple example demonstrating asynchronous file reading:

```javascript
const { readFile } = require('fs');

console.log('started a first task');

readFile('./content/first.txt', 'utf8', (err, result) => {
    if(err) {
        console.log(err);
        return
    }
    console.log(result);
    console.log('completed first task');
})
console.log('starting next task');
```

## Output

When you run this code, you'll see:

```
started a first task
starting next task
Hello this is first text file
completed first task
```

## How It Works

### 1. Synchronous Execution
First, JavaScript executes the code line by line:

```javascript
console.log('started a first task');
```

This outputs "started a first task" immediately.

### 2. Asynchronous Operations
When JavaScript encounters an asynchronous operation like `readFile()`:

```javascript
readFile('./content/first.txt', 'utf8', (callback function))
```

It doesn't wait for the file reading to complete. Instead:
- The operation is delegated to the operating system
- JavaScript continues executing the next lines of code
- The callback function is registered to be executed later

### 3. Continued Execution
JavaScript continues to the next line:

```javascript
console.log('starting next task');
```

This outputs "starting next task" while the file is still being read.

### 4. Event Loop
After the main code finishes executing, the event loop starts monitoring for completed asynchronous operations:
- When the file reading finishes, its callback function is placed in the callback queue
- The event loop checks if the call stack is empty
- If the call stack is empty, it takes the callback from the queue and puts it on the stack for execution

### 5. Callback Execution
The callback function runs, outputting:

```
Hello this is first text file
completed first task
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Non-blocking I/O**: JavaScript doesn't halt execution while waiting for I/O operations.
2. **Single-threaded but concurrent**: JavaScript can handle multiple operations concurrently through the event loop.
3. **Execution order**: Code outside callbacks runs before code inside callbacks, regardless of how fast the asynchronous operation completes.
4. **Call stack & callback queue**: The event loop monitors these to manage execution flow.

## Visualization

The JavaScript runtime can be visualized with these components:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│        Call Stack       │
└─────────────────────────┘
          ↑    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│        Event Loop       │
└─────────────────────────┘
          ↑    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      Callback Queue     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
