# The Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course 2025

## 🚀 Chapter 1: Welcome & First Encounter with Agentic AI

### 👋 Introduction
- **Instructor**: Ed Donner — ex-Managing Director at J.P. Morgan, two-time AI startup co-founder.
- The course spans **6 weeks** with **8 hands-on projects** focused on building autonomous AI agents.
- Ed skips the traditional self-intro and dives right into **action-first learning**.

---

### 🧠 First Look: Autonomous Agents in Action (with `N810`)
- **Platform used**: [N810](https://www.n8n.io/) — a low-code/no-code AI-powered workflow automation tool.
- Purpose: Show a quick, visual demonstration of agentic AI systems using a simple smart home integration.

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Workflow Built in the Demo
1. **Start with a chat input** (user interacts via chat window).
2. **Add an AI agent** to process the chat.
3. **Attach a chat model** (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT via API key).
4. **Connect a tool**:
   - Ed uses the **Philips Hue** light system.
   - AI can adjust `brightness` and `hue` (color) fields autonomously.
5. **Run a chat**:
   - Example: “Turn the lights on bright white” → lights react.
   - Example: “Pick red or blue” → AI chooses autonomously (red in this case).

---

### 🧪 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Tool usage**: How agents can be equipped with external tools (e.g., smart devices, web APIs).
- **Autonomy**: Agent **makes decisions** (e.g., chooses a color) instead of just executing commands.
- **LLMs + tools = agency**: Combining chat models with tools unlocks real-world action.

---

### 🛠️ What's Next
- **Hands-on coding** begins after this chapter.
- **No more no-code tools** like N810 going forward.
- Students will start building agentic AI systems from scratch using code and frameworks.

---

### ✅ Suggested Student Actions
- Try out **N810** to get a feel for agent workflows.
- Setup **OpenAI API key** or try **Olama** as a free alternative.
- Prepare to write code and build agent frameworks in upcoming weeks.

---

### 📌 Takeaway
This chapter sets the tone: Agentic AI isn’t just theoretical. It's actionable, interactive, and something you can build — and **you will**.

> “You just saw it making its own decision... all through N810’s web app. That’s Agentic AI in action.”
