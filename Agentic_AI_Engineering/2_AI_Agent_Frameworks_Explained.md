# The Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course 2025

## 📘 Chapter 2: What This Course Is Really About

### 🎯 Course Structure & Philosophy

This course is divided into **6 weekly modules**, each progressively building your skills in **Agentic AI Engineering**, covering:

1. **Theory** – Understand what agents are and what defines agentic architectures.
2. **Frameworks** – Learn and use cutting-edge platforms to build AI agents.
3. **Projects** – Build hands-on projects (both fun and commercial) to reinforce skills.

Each week has 5 days of lessons (Monday–Friday), with weekends off. The curriculum is designed as a *motivated 6-week journey*, but learners can progress at their own pace.

### 📅 Weekly Breakdown

#### Week 1 – **Foundations**
- No frameworks yet — LLMs interacting natively.
- First project: Build a **career alter ego agent** you can deploy on a website to answer career-related questions instead of using a resume.

#### Week 2 – **OpenAI Agents SDK**
- Elegant, simple, and flexible.
- Learn to build with guardrails.
- Project: **Deep Research** app.

#### Week 3 – **Crew.ai**
- Fan favorite: Low-code approach to building agent crews via configuration.
- Build multiple projects with crew-based collaboration.

#### Week 4 – **LangGraph**
- Advanced and powerful, full-code solution.
- Explore complex agent behaviors and state management.

#### Week 5 – **Microsoft Autogen**
- Multi-agent collaboration in shared remote environments.
- Explore Autogen’s unique environment and functionality.

#### Week 6 – **Capstone + MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- Build an agent ecosystem using **Anthropic’s MCP**, allowing models to interoperate and share capabilities via a common protocol.
- Final project: Bring everything together from previous weeks.

### 🚧 Major Projects (Highlights)

Projects 5 to 8 are the most advanced and exciting:

- **Project 5**: Build a simulated engineering team of agents (Frontend, Backend, Lead, Tester) that collaborate to build software.
- **Project 6 (Sidekick)**: Agent that interacts with a browser in real-time alongside you (inspired by Marnus AI, but local).
- **Project 7 (Creator)**: Meta-agent platform that can generate and launch new agents. Includes commercial functionality.
- **Project 8 (Capstone)**: Multi-agent **financial market simulator** that reads stock prices, financial news, SEC filings, and simulates trading with investment logic.

> Fun twist: The system that tracks agent trading performance is written by Project 5’s AI engineering team.

### 🧠 Learning Goals

By the end of the course, you'll:
- Understand agentic architectures deeply.
- Master at least 5 frameworks and protocols.
- Build and deploy **production-ready agentic systems**.
- Be capable of applying these skills commercially (B2B/B2C).
